## Python Chatbot
Developed a chatbot based on Natural Language Processing techniques using Deep Learning. The Laptop Buying Guide website that we have created contains all the information needed by a user while buying a laptop. The chatbot also involves a feature to predict the price of a laptop based on its configuration such as RAM, storage size, OS, processor and so on. The database was manually created by us and is stored in intents.json file.

### Additional Features Of Chatbot
a) The chatbot can also accept voice based natural language query as input. <br/>
b) The chatbot also has a speak out feature to hear to the chatbot replies.<br/>
c) The chatbot can also predict price of laptop using an already trained ML model by having configuration of the laptop.

### Steps to run the project:-
a) Create a virtual environment using **- py -3 -m venv .venv** and activate the virtual environment using **.venv\scripts\activate** <br/>
b) Install all the libraries that are present in requirements.txt file.<br/>
c) Run the app by entering python -m flask run in the terminal.<br/>

### Technologies Used:-
a) The CNN Model architecture was defined by us using tensorflow in python. <br/>
b) The tool is deployed using Flask framework in Python<br/>
c) The web app is designed using HTML, CSS and JS<br/>
